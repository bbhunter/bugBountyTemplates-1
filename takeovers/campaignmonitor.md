## Title

## Summary

The domain `$domain` was poiting to `CNAME` cname.createsend.com, but it was not actively used in the service Campaign Monitor. Because this service does not re-verify custom domains I was able to take it over.

**Steps to reproduce **

Go to URL: $URL

Webarchive version: $URL2

Domain ownership: https://who.is/whois/$domain

## Impact

The company won't be able to use this domain anymore with Campaign monitor service.

Create content in the domain as these:

$URL
