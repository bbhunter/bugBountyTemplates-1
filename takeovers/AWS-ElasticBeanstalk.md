# ElasticBean subdomain takeover [$DOMAIN]

## Summary

The subdomain signal-api.paytm.com was pointing to an ElasticBean instance ($CNAME), but that endpoint was not registered. 

## Steps to reproduce
 
Just go to $URL

You'll see a default page. 

## Impact

It's extremely vulnerable to attacks as a malicious user could create any web page with any content and host it on the vulnerable domain. This would allow them to post malicious content which would be mistaken for a valid site. 

They could perform several attacks like:
 - Cookie Stealing
 - Phishing campaigns. 
 - Bypass Content-Security Policies and CORS.

 
## Recommendations for fix

* Remove the affected DNS record if not used
